#SatanCMS

A blogging CMS I'm making because I dislike Wordpress and love satan. Markdown is the text editor.

Documentation / Install directions will come soon after I finish a good working copy of SatanCMS.

### To Do

- Add password protection to admin panel <sup>important</sup>
- ~~"Create Post" button in admin panel~~
- ~~Better default styles for homepage~~
- .htaccess code for SEO-friendly page links
- Ability to add pages to site w/ content
- ~~Blog drafts preview and "Publish / Draft" options in editor~~
- Image uploading / cropping, other media in the future (videos, mp3, etc.)
- Template options
- Ability to grab fonts from google webfonts
- Ability to change meta & header info
- Titles on links in the admin panel
- ~~Process markdown with PHP so it displays right on the front-end~~
- Error / Success fancy message
- More reminders in this to-do list
