#SatanCMS

A blogging CMS I'm making because I dislike Wordpress and love satan. Markdown is the text editor.

Documentation / Install directions will come soon after I finish a good working copy of SatanCMS.

### To Do

- Add password protection to admin panel
- "Create Post" button in admin panel
- Better default styles for homepage
- .htaccess code for SEO-friendly page links
- Ability to add pages to site w/ content
- Blog drafts preview and "Publish / Draft" options in editor
- Image uploading / cropping, other media in the future (videos, mp3, etc.)
- Template options
- More reminders in this to-do list
